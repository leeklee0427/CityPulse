### App Information

CityPulse harnesses an extensive array of data, sourcing information from reputable platforms like Census.gov, Salary.com, WalletHub.com, etc.

The pivotal metrics encompass a spectrum of seven factors such as employment, cost, safety, recreation, etc. These metrics, carefully weighted and curated, empower users to navigate relocation decisions with a wealth of informed insights.

By regularly refreshing the data utilized within the application, CityPulse remains dynamic and aligned with the latest trends and conditions, offering users a consistently reliable tool for making well-informed decisions about their prospective relocations.
